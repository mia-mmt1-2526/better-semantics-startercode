# Assignment: Better semantics

*PLEASE READ THIS **ENTIRE** DOCUMENT FIRST*

## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. The index.html uses several HTML tags that aren't that semantic (like span and div). Replace those tags with these more [semantic](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) tags:

- header
- main
- footer
- strong
- h1
- h2

Only replace HTML tags, do *not* edit the CSS code!

If you replaced the tags correctly the result should look like this:
